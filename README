                 Release of version 1.61 of Acme::EyeDrops
===========================================================================

NAME
    Acme::EyeDrops - Visual Programming in Perl

SYNOPSIS
    use Acme::EyeDrops qw(sightly);

    print sightly( { Shape       => 'camel',
                     SourceFile  => 'eyesore.pl' } );

DESCRIPTION
    Acme::EyeDrops converts a Perl program into an equivalent one,
    but without all those unsightly letters and numbers.

    In a Visual Programming breakthrough, EyeDrops allows you to pour
    the generated program into various shapes, such as UML diagrams,
    enabling you to instantly understand how the program works just
    by glancing at its new and improved visual representation.

INSTALLATION
    Most of you already know the drill:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    Alternatively, if you have Module::Build installed, you can:

        perl Build.PL
        perl Build
        perl Build test
        perl Build install

    It's all pure Perl, so you can also install by putting the .pm
    file and *.eye files in the appropriate local sub-directory.

    This module should work on all Windows and Unix variants for
    Perl 5.6 and above, but is untested on other platforms.
